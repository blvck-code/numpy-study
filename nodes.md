## Numpy

### What is Numpy?
- NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPyâ€™s array objects are more memory-efficient and perform better than Python lists, which is essential for tasks in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning
- They can be one-dimensional (like a list), two-dimensional (like a matrix) or multi-dimensional (like a table with rows and columns).
- Faster to read less bytes of memory
- No type checking when iterating though objects

### Numpy vs List
- List -> Very slow
- Numpy -> Very fast (uses fixed type, contiguous memory)
- 

### Applications of Numpy
- Mathematics (MATLAB Replacement)
- Plotting (Matplotlib)
- Backend (Pandas, Connect 4, Digital Photography)
- Machine Learning
